    <h3>A Semantic Local Code Search Platform</h3>
  </header>

  <main>

      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>
        Searching for the right code snippet is daunting and not a trivial task. Online platforms such as Github.com or
          searchcode.com provide tools to search, they are limited to publicly available and internet-hosted code.
          However, during the development of research prototypes or confidential tools, it is preferable to store
          source code locally. Consequently, the use of external code search tools becomes impractical. Here,
          we present Selma: a local code search platform that enables term-based and semantic retrieval of source code.
          Selma searches source code and comments, annotates undocumented code to enable term-based search
          in natural language, and trains locally deployed neural models for code retrieval.

      <h4>System</h4>
      <p>
        With SELMA you can choose two different index types: BM25 and CodeColBERT. BM25 offers stable results, but
          does only perform search using string-matching. CodeColBERT is based on powerful Transformer-Encoder-Models,
          which are trained to "understand" the users query and find matching code snippets. Because of this, it delivers
          better results than BM25. Therefore, <b>we recommend using the CodeColBERT index.</b>
          However, it requires at least one GPU to run, while BM25 does not. If the server where the SELMA is deployed
          does not have access to a GPU with CUDA support, we suggest using the BM25 index.
      </p>
      <p>
          To enable semantic code search also when using BM25, SELMA offers the Code Expansion feature. Using two
          Transformer-based models, SELMA generates documentation for each code snippet. This way, the code is annotated
          using natural language words which helps the BM25 algorithm to find more relevant results when searching
          using natural language keywords. We apply two different models to increase the diversity of generated terms,
          since we found that the generation of both models overlaps by only 36% - 50%. Therefore, <b>we recommend using both
          models for code expansion.</b>
          However, each of the models can be disabled and during the setup process this entire feature can be
          activated or not. Keep in mind that this process of generating documentation strings can take some time.
          In the following image, the impact of the code expansion feature is visible. The documentation
          generated by the models is depicted in blue. This way, the user can also find this code snippet when searching
          for "mean" even though this word does occur in the code or in its documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
          The speed at which results can be delivered by the system heavily relies on several factors,
          including the hardware configuration of the server, the size of the index
          (corresponding to the size of the code repositories), and the specific type of index being employed.
          In general, BM25 provides a swift search experience. On the other hand, the CodeColBERT index is
          approximately 10 times slower, but it remains applicable in real-world scenarios, as demonstrated in our videos.
        As previously mentioned, if a GPU is not available, we recommend opting for BM25. Moreover, when dealing with an
          extensive volume of code, CodeColBERT might exhibit slower performance. In such cases, we suggest starting
          with CodeColBERT and assessing its retrieval speed. If it fails to meet your expectations, transitioning
          to BM25 is advantageous due to its faster retrieval times.
